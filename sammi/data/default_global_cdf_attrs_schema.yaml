Data_product_descriptor:
  description: >
    This is an optional field that may not be needed for all products.

Data_type:
  description: >
    This attribute identifies the data type of the CDF data set.
    Both a long name and a short name are given.
    For ISTP exchangeable data products the values are "Kn>Key Parameter" for approximately minute averaged survey data, and "Hn>High Resolution data" for certified data of higher resolution than Key Parameters.
    Key Parameters can run from 0 to 9 to allow for more than one kind of data product.
    For Cluster/CSDS this can either be "SP>Summary Parameter" or "PP>Prime Parameter".
    Other possible data types may be defined in future.
    If any of these data sets are modified or used to produce derived products, the data type should be, e.g., "Mn>Modified Data n", where n is from 0 to 9.
    Example: "L2-Summary>level 2 summary"

    Each time this particular data file is reproduced - for recalibration or other reasons - the Data_version is incremented by 1.
